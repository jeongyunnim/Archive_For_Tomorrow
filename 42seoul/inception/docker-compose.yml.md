## Compose file
The default path for a Compose file is `compose.yaml` (preferred) or `compose.yml` that is placed in the working directory. Compose also supports `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.yml` for backwards compatibility of earlier versions. If both files exist, Compose prefers the canonical `compose.yaml`.
